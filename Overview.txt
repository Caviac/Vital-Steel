There exist six Vital Souls of the World. Each can be harnessed by a human Vessel to achieve great power. When a Vessel dies, the Vital Soul is left behind, and may be claimed by whoever next makes contact with it.

The player receives a sword called Vital Steel. Forged with 6 human souls, it has the ability to store 6 Vital Souls. The player is tasked with hunting down each of the Vessels to seal their power within Vital Steel.

Vital Thunder (Yellow)
Young girl, inventor and gamer that desired the fasted reflexes and response times.

Vital Earth (Brown)
Bodybuilder that always wanted to become stronger and stronger. Defeated the previous Vital Earth in a wrestling match before killing him.

Vital Life (Gold)
Doctor that wanted to power to save all of his patients. Eventually this power corrupted him, causing him to only save those he deemed worthy.

Vital Death (Black)
An assassin that killed a Vital Soul on a contract, but betrayed her employer, desiring the power for herself. She believed it would help her fulfill her contracts, but found that it made them boring and unfulfilling instead. Now, surrounded by death, she tries to be a positive influence by helping those that come to her for help ending their life.

"All that approach me seek death, one way or another. Sometimes their own, and sometimes mine. Regardless of what they seek, they will most certainly find the former."

Vital Steel tricks the player into collecting all 6 of the other souls, then tries to kill them. Final boss fight is against the sword itself. Player must make it charge into walls, grab it when it gets stuck, and use it to destroy each of the 6 Vital Souls before destroying the sword itself.
